# === fit_afterpulse_dt.C: fit the meausred dt distribution saved in the input file, and produce a fitted dt function. 
#
# === fit_afterpulse_rate.C: fit the meausured after pulse rate for various first hit charge (p.e.) by a linear function. 
#
# === NOTE: The outputs of the above two macros will be used as the input of afterpulse simulation.
